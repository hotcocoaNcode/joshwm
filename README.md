> *certified tryharding for hack club riceathon*
_____
`joshwm` is a "blazingly fast" window manager written in Rust with Xlib, for the Hack Club Riceathon.
## Why?
Because I wanted to learn Rust (better). 
I'm REALLY bad at making anything look good, and they said I could write a WM instead of customizing one, which is a lot more my speed.
## Okay, but why do the riceathon if you can't rice?
Funny. Also, they said I could either get a blahaj or thigh highs which are both a worthy cause.
## Why Xlib rather than XCB?
I'm not ballsy enough for that. Let me take a break from Vulkan in peace, please...
